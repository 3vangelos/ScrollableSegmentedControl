# ScrollableSegmentedControl

ScrollableSegmentedControl is replacement for UISegmentedControl that becomes scrollable when the total width of all segments exceeds the width of the control itself. 

ScrollableSegmentedControl supports 4 styles of segments: text only, image only, text with image on top and text with image on left.
